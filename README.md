# Terminal File Explorer (Bash)

## About the Project

This project is a terminal-based file explorer written entirely in Bash. It was developed as part of an assignment for the "Operating Systems" course at university.

Throughout this project, I learned a lotâ€”especially about Bash scripting and terminal commands. I translated various terminal operations into Bash functions and structured the code in a way that makes it easy to read and understand, even for someone unfamiliar with Bash or Linux. I took care to group logic into meaningful functions and use clear naming conventions that describe what each part of the code does.

## Purpose

This project is not intended for real-world use, but rather as a demonstration of my learning process, problem-solving, and code organization. It serves as a portfolio piece showing how I approached a complex terminal-based application using only Bash.

After exploring similar applications written in Go, Python, or C, I now understand why Bash is not the ideal choice for building interactive or large-scale terminal applications. That said, this project helped me deepen my understanding of Linux, terminal behavior, and the limits of shell scripting.

## What I Learned

- Practical usage of terminal commands and how they interact with scripts
- Structuring Bash code into modular, readable functions
- Handling user input and rendering interactive interfaces inside the terminal
- The differences between various terminal environments and their capabilities (including GPU-accelerated ones)
- Why scripting languages have their limitations and when to choose other technologies

## Final Thoughts

Even though this tool may never be used in practice, it was a valuable experience. It allowed me to experiment, fail, refactor, and ultimately build something that helped me grow as a developer. I now have a better appreciation for both the power and limitations of Bash.

Thanks for reading!
